# A file to track things that are currently being worked on by each member, as well as a place to track what needs to be done

# To Do
## ~~pretty much everything ~~
## ~~we should start by getting the .html pages sorted out, a good place to start would be by creating blank .html pages for the pages we need to make~~
## start adding content to pages, come up with uniform design and color scheme

### so far we have: buzz.html, club.html, account-settings.html, homepage.html, profile.html, createAccount.html, registerClub.html, resetPassword.html, contact.html, ourMission.html(subject to change)

### next we need to come up with a common design/color scheme for the pages. Also, come up with a uniform styling (grid, flexbox, etc) for how the general layout of each page will look. It should have a uniform header/footer, etc.

refer to styles.css for header of other pages
