# A file to track things that are currently being worked on by each member, as well as a place to track what needs to be done

# To Do
## pretty much everything
## we should start by getting the .html pages sorted out, a good place to start would be by creating blank .html pages for the pages we need to make... ie
## "buzz.html", "register.html", "about.html" etc. 

# so far we have:
# buzz.html, club.html, account-settings.html, homepage.html, profile.html, createAccount.html, registerClub.html, resetPassword.html, contact.html, ourMission.html(placeholder)
