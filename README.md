# CS268 Project - Bluegold Buzz

# To Do
## ~~pretty much everything~~
## ~~we should start by getting the .html pages sorted out, a good place to start would be by creating blank .html pages for the pages we need to make~~
## start adding content to pages, come up with uniform design and color scheme

### ~~so far we have: buzz.html, club.html, account-settings.html, homepage.html, profile.html, createAccount.html, registerClub.html, resetPassword.html, contact.html, ourMission.html(subject to change)~~

### ~~next we need to come up with a common design/color scheme for the pages. Also, come up with a uniform styling (grid, flexbox, etc) for how the general layout of each page will look. It should have a uniform header/footer, etc.~~

### refer to styles.css for header of other pages

### create additional css files for other pages so it is easier to organise and troubleshoot 

### 1) homepage; 2) buzz; 3) club; 4) createAccount; 5) registerClub; 6) profile; 7) resetPassword; 8) accountSettings; 9) about; 10) contact
